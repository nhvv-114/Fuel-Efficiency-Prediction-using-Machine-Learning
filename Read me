## Introduction
The **Fuel Efficiency Prediction** project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the fuel efficiency (measured in km per liter) of vehicles based on various features. Accurate predictions can help manufacturers and consumers make informed decisions about vehicle design and selection for better fuel economy.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). It includes various attributes such as:

- Engine displacement  
- Number of cylinders  
- Vehicle weight  
- Horsepower  
- Acceleration  
- Model year  
- Origin of the car  

### Dataset Preprocessing
The dataset required the following preprocessing steps:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features
- Normalizing numerical features

## Project Objectives
- Analyze the features influencing fuel efficiency.
- Build machine learning models to predict fuel efficiency.
- Evaluate model performance and select the best-performing algorithm.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  
## Detailed Project Execution
### Data Loading and Preprocessing
1. **Data Loading:**  
   - The dataset was loaded using Pandas and inspected for missing values and inconsistencies.

2. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Missing values were imputed where necessary.  
   - Outliers were identified and treated.

3. **Data Transformation:**  
   - Categorical features such as car origin were one-hot encoded.  
   - Numerical features were scaled using Min-Max normalization to ensure uniformity.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized the distribution of fuel efficiency and other features.
- Analyzed correlations between features and target variable (fuel efficiency).
- Key insights included:
  - Negative correlation between engine displacement and fuel efficiency.
  - Positive correlation between acceleration and fuel efficiency.

### Model Selection and Training
1. **Baseline Model:**  
   - Linear Regression was used as a baseline model.

2. **Advanced Models:**  
   - Decision Tree and Random Forest models were implemented for better prediction capabilities.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
   - Grid search was conducted to optimize hyperparameters for Decision Tree and Random Forest models.

### Model Evaluation
- The models were evaluated using metrics such as:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R-squared (R²)

| Model           | MAE  | MSE   | R²   |
|-----------------|------|-------|-------|
| Linear Regression | X.XX | X.XX  | X.XX  |
| Decision Tree    | X.XX | X.XX  | X.XX  |
| Random Forest    | X.XX | X.XX  | X.XX  |

The **Random Forest model** achieved the best performance with the highest R² score.

## Results and Analysis
The project demonstrated that certain features, such as engine displacement and weight, have a significant impact on fuel efficiency. The trained model can reliably predict fuel efficiency based on these features.
